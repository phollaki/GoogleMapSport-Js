# Sport-App-With-Leafletjs-Library
App where you can store your 🏃‍♂️ and 🚴‍♂️ with details. First when you load this application, it asks for your location data 🗺. If you allow it ✅ then your location will appear on the right side of the screen. It uses a third party library -> Leaflet.js 🍃 which can display your location on a map, with your coordinates. After you can click on the map and mark a place where you did sport. You can choose between two sport: running, cycling. Then user can define details of the sport for example: duration ⏲, distance 🔭.  App will store your marked places and sport events when you reload the page. Whole architecture of this application built in OOP way, when you set the details of your sport it creates an object and store it in an array. Will make features in the future! 🔜🔮
